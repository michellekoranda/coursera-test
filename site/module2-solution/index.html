            <section>Chickens sometimes choose to “work” for their food. This behavior is called contra-freeloading. In
            studies, chickens have been observed pressing a button for food instead of eating from a readily available source. They
            enjoy puzzle feeders and scratching up their food from varied sources.

            <p class = "section-header">Sushi</p>
            <section>Sushi gained popularity as a Tokyo street food, but the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 changed everything. Many sushi
                chefs, displaced by the earthquake, started opening restaurants due to lower real estate prices. This led to sushi
                becoming popular across Japan.
